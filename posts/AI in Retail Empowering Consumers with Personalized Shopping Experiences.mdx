Augmented reality applications allow shoppers  to virtually try on products, reducing the  likelihood of returns and enhancing customer satisfaction.

### Ethical Considerations: Navigating the Delicate Balance

While AI holds immense promise for  revolutionizing retail,  it also presents a unique  set of ethical considerations that retailers must navigate with utmost care. Transparency in data collection, safeguarding customer privacy, and avoiding biases are paramount to building trust and maintaining customer loyalty in the age  of AI. Retailers must  strike a delicate balance between leveraging  AI's capabilities and  upholding ethical standards, ensuring that AI serves as a force for good  in the realm of retail.
